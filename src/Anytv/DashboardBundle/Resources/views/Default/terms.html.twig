<h4>Key Points</h4>

<div style="font-size:120%">

<p><b>Main rule:</b> You must use relevant videos or live streams to promote our Play Now links.</p>

<p>They do not need to be made by you (you can embed anyone's videos or live streams), but they do need to be relevant.</p>

<p><b>How?</b></p>

Add your Play Now links in your video or live stream description, or embed videos on wikis, forums and websites with a convenient Play Now link from our dashboard beneath the video.</p>

<p><b>Why?</b></p>

<p>Because any.TV is a new kind of YouTube Network that creates video recommendation revenue. If you, our partners, do not use videos or live streams, how can we be a new kind of YouTube Network?</p>

<p><b>What is video recommendation revenue?</b></p>

<p>You recommend things you love in video and tell your audience where to go to get them using our Play Now links!</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold"><b style="color:#72a700">Good:</b> Gameplay videos or live streams</p>
<p>Promote games you love on YouTube and Twitch and add your Play Now link as a convenient way to play the game. No, this is not a paid product placement, this is just a link.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold"><b style="color:red">Bad:</b> Contests where Play Now links are one of the steps to enter</p>
<p>Why is this bad? Think from the publisher's perspective: They are paying for sign-ups with the expectation that each person is genuinely interested to try their product, not enter your contest.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold"><b style="color:#72a700">Good:</b> Contests that challenge people to play a game</p>
<p>For example: Challenge people to play a game: "How fast can you level up from 1 to 10? Click the Play Now link below to play! Post a video response proving your achievement and I will giveaway a game timecard to the winner."</p>

<p>These contests or giveaways create genuine interest in the game (who would play from level 1 to 10 if they have zero interest in the game?) which is exactly what game publishers want.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold"><b style="color:red">Bad:</b> Incentivized traffic</p>
<p>Never use Play Now links to get something else, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minecraft server access (eg: Sign up to this game, then get access to our Minecraft server)</li>
<li>Video or live streaming incentive (eg: If you sign up to this game, I will make another video or I will start live streaming)</li>
<li>Contests or giveaways as described in "Bad: Contests" above.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose not to follow these Terms & Conditions, your account <b style="color:red">will be blocked</b>. We don't want that to happen, so please follow them :-)</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p><b>Affiliate Program Operating Agreement</b></p>
<p>This Affiliate Program Operating Agreement
(the "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between any.TV ("any.TV" or "we"), 
and you, ("you" or "Affiliate") the party submitting an application to become a any.TV  affiliate).
The terms and conditions contained in this Agreement apply to your participation with
www.dashboard.tm ("Affiliate Program"). Each Affiliate Program offer (an "Offer") may
be for any offering by any.TV or a third party (each such third party a "Client") and
may link to a specific web site for that particular Offer ("Program Web Site").
Furthermore, each Offer may have additional terms and conditions on pages within the
Affiliate Program and are incorporated as part of this Agreement. By submitting an
application or participating in an Offer, you expressly consent to all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<h4> Enrollment in the Affiliate Program</h4>
			<p>
				You must submit an Affiliate Program application from our website. You must
				 accurately complete the application to become an affiliate (and provide us with future
				 updates) and not use any aliases or other means to mask your true identity or contact
				 information. After we review your application, we will notify you of your acceptance
				 or rejection to the Affiliate Program, generally within two (2) business days. We may
				 accept or reject your application at our sole discretion for any reason.			</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4> Obligations of the Parties</h4>
			<p>
				Subject to our acceptance of you as an affiliate and your continued compliance
				with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, any.TV agrees as follows:			</p>
				<ol>
					<li><p>
					We will make available to you via the Affiliate Program graphic and textual
					links to the Program Web Site and/or other creative materials (collectively,
					the "Links") which you may display on web sites owned or controlled by you,
					in emails sent by you and clearly identified as coming from you and in online
					advertisements (collectively, "Media"). The Links will serve to identify you
					as a member of our Affiliate Program and will establish a link from your
					Media to the Program Web Site.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					We will pay Affiliate for each Qualified Action (the "Commission"). A
					"Qualified Action" means an individual person who (i) accesses the Program
					Web Site via the Link, where the Link is the last link to the Program Web
					Site, (ii) is not a computer generated user, such as a robot, spider, computer
					script or other automated, artificial or fraudulent method to appear like an
					individual, real live person, (iii) is not using pre-populated fields (iv)
					completes all of the information required for such action within the time
					period allowed by any.TV and (v) is not later determined by any.TV to
					be fraudulent, incomplete, unqualified or a duplicate.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					We will pay you any Commissions earned monthly, provided that your
					account is currently greater than $0. Accounts with a balance of less than
					$0 will roll over to the next month, and will continue to roll over monthly
					until $0 is reached. We reserve the right to charge back to your account any
					previously paid Qualified Actions that are later determined to have not met
					the requirements to be a Qualified Action.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					Payment for Commissions is dependent upon Clients providing such funds to
					any.TV, and therefore, you agree that any.TV shall only be liable to you
					for Commissions to the extent that any.TV has received such funds from
					the Clients. You hereby release any.TV from any claim for Commissions if
					any.TV has not received such funds from the Clients.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					any.TV shall automatically generate an invoice on behalf of Affiliate for all
					Commissions payable under this Agreement and shall remit payment to
					Affiliate based upon that invoice. All tracking of Links and determinations of
					Qualified Actions and Commissions shall be made by any.TV in its sole
					discretion. In the event that Affiliate disputes in good faith any portion of an
					invoice, Affiliate must submit that dispute to any.TV in writing and in
					sufficient detail within thirty (30) days of the date on the invoice. If Affiliate
					does not dispute the invoice as set forth herein, then Affiliate agrees that it
					irrevocably waives any claims based upon that invoice. In the event that
					Affiliate is also tracking Qualified Actions and Affiliate claims a discrepancy,
					Affiliate must provide any.TV with Affiliate's reports within three (3) days
					after 30th day of the calendar month, and if any.TV's and Affiliate's
					reported statistics vary by more than 10%  and any.TV reasonably
					determines that Affiliate has used generally accepted industry methods to
					track Qualified Actions, then any.TV and Affiliate agree to make a good
					faith effort to arrive at a reconciliation. If the parties are unable to arrive at a
					reconciliation, then any.TV's numbers shall govern.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					If Affiliate has an outstanding balance due to any.TV under this Agreement
					or any other agreement between the Affiliate and any.TV, whether or not
					related to the Affiliate Program, Affiliate agrees that any.TV may offset
					any such amounts due to any.TV from amounts payable to Affiliate under
					this Agreement.					</p></li>
				</ol>
			
			<p>Affiliate also agrees to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><p>
					Have sole responsibility for the development, operation, and maintenance
					of, and all content on or linked to, your Media.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					Ensure that all materials posted on your Media or otherwise used in
					connection with the Affiliate Program (i) are not illegal, (ii) do not infringe
					upon the intellectual property or personal rights of any third party and (iii)
					do not contain or link to any material which is harmful, threatening,
					defamatory, obscene, sexually explicit, harassing, promotes violence,
					promotes discrimination (whether based on sex, religion, race, ethnicity,
					nationality, disability or age), promotes illegal activities (such as
					gambling), contains profanity or otherwise contains materials that
					any.TV informs you that it considers objectionable (collectively,
					"Objectionable Content").					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					Not make any representations, warranties or other statements concerning
					any.TV or Client or any of their respective products or services, except as expressly authorized herein.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					Make sure that your Media does not copy or resemble the look and feel of
					the Program Web Site or create the impression that your Media is endorsed
					by any.TV or Clients or a part of the Program Web Site, without prior
					written permission from us.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					Comply with all (i) obligations, requirements and restrictions under this
					Agreement and (ii) laws, rules and regulations as they relate to your
					business, your Media or your use of the Links.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					Comply with the terms, conditions, guidelines and policies of any third
					party services used by Affiliate in connection with the Affiliate Program,
					including but not limited to, email providers, social networking services
					and ad networks.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					Always prominently post and make available to end-users, including prior
					to the collection of any personally identifiable information, a privacy
					policy in compliance with all applicable laws that clearly and thoroughly
					discloses all information collection, use and sharing practices, including
					providing for the collection of such personally identifiable information in
					connection with the Affiliate Program and the provision of such personally
					identifiable information to any.TV and Clients for use as intended by
					any.TV and Clients.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					Always prominently post and make available to end-users any terms and
					conditions in connection with the Offer set forth by any.TV or Client, or
					as required by applicable laws regarding such Offers.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					Make sure to not place any.TV ads on any online auction platform (i.e. eBay, Amazon, etc).					</p></li>
				</ol>
			
			<p>The following additional program-specific terms shall apply to any promotional
			programs set forth below:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><p>
					Email Campaigns. For all email campaigns, Affiliate must download the
					"Suppression List" from the Offers section of any.TV.
					 Affiliate shall filter its email list by removing any entries appearing 
					on the Suppression List and will only send emails to the remaining addresses 
					on its email list. any.TV will provide an opt-out method in all Links, 
					however, if any opt-out requests come directly to Affiliate, Affiliate 
					shall immediately forward them to any.TV at support@any.tv. 
					Affiliate's emails containing the Links may not include any content other 
					than the Links, except as required by applicable law.						<ol>
							<li><p>
							Affiliate agrees that failure to download the Suppression List and remove
							all emails from the database before mailing may result in Commission
							withholdings, removal or suspension from all or part of the Affiliate
							Program, possible legal action and any other rights or remedies available
							to any.TV pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. Affiliate further
							agrees that it will not mail or market to any suppression files generated
							through the any.TV network, and that doing so may result in
							Commission withholdings, removal or suspension from the Affiliate
							Program, possible legal action and any other rights or remedies available
							to any.TV pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.							</p></li>
						</ol>
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					Advertising Campaigns. No Links can appear to be associated with or be
					positioned on chat rooms or bulletin boards unless otherwise agreed by
					any.TV in writing. Any pop-ups/unders used for the Affiliate Program shall
					be clearly identified as Affiliate served in the title bar of the window and any
					client-side ad serving software used by Affiliate shall only have been installed
					on an end-user's computer if the function of the software is clearly disclosed
					to end-users prior to installation, the installation is pursuant to an
					affirmatively accepted and plain-english end user license agreement and the
					software be easily removed according to generally accepted methods.					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					Affiliate Network Campaigns. For all Affiliate's that maintain their own
					affiliate networks, Affiliate agrees to place the Links in its affiliate network
					(the "Network") for access and use by those affiliates in Affiliate's Network
					(each a "Third Party Affiliate"). Affiliate agrees that it will expressly forbid
					any Third Party Affiliate to modify the Links in any way. Affiliate agrees to
					maintain its Network according to the highest industry standards. Affiliate
					shall not permit any party to be a Third Party Affiliate whose web site or
					business model involves content containing Objectionable Content. All Third
					Party Affiliates must be in good standing with Affiliate. Affiliate must require
					and confirm that all Third Party Affiliates affirmatively accept, through
					verifiable means, this Agreement prior to obtaining access to the Links.
					Affiliate shall promptly terminate any Third Party Affiliate who takes, or
					could reasonably be expected to take, any action that violates the terms and
					conditions of this Agreement. In the event that either party suspects any
					wrongdoing by a Third Party Affiliate with respect to the Links, Affiliate
					shall promptly disclose to any.TV the identity and contact information for
					such Third Party Affiliate. Affiliate shall promptly remove any Third Party
					Affiliate from the Affiliate Program and terminate their access to future
					Offers of any.TV in the Network upon written notice from any.TV.
					Unless any.TV has been provided with all truthful and complete contact
					information for a Third Party Affiliate and such Third Party Affiliate has
					affirmatively accepted this Agreement as recorded by any.TV, Affiliate
					shall remain liable for all acts or omissions of any Third Party Affiliate.					</p></li>
